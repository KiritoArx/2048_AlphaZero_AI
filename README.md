# 2048 AlphaZero AI

This repository contains a minimal C++ implementation of a dropping-tile merge board. The `merge.cpp` and `merge.hpp` files provide a small board representation and resolve logic inspired by 2048-style games. A simple `main.cpp` demonstrates dropping tiles and printing the board.

To compile the example program:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 merge.cpp main.cpp -o merge_example
./merge_example
```

The code is intended to be a starting point for experimenting with Monte Carlo Tree Search and AlphaZero-style training.
